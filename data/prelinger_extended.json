The documentary opens in the mile-high bauxite mines of Jamaica, from which the bauxite ore is conveyed over an aerial tramway to waiting ships, then carried to a factory. At the factory, the ore is digested, settled, washed and \"unlocked\" from the earth. Emerging as a snow-white powder, the \"alumina\" is used for soil conditioning, as an abrasive and for conversion to solid sluminum at reduction plants through the electrolytic process. To vivify the versatility and flexibility of the metal, the film employs \"marching\" ingots, blooms, billets and extruded shapes. Rapidly, the film pictures aluminum applications in car styling, home appliances, packaging, \"Reynolds Wrap\" for cooking and preserving, as a \"do-it-yourself\" material, and as the key metal in jet airplanes, Diesel engines, buses and heavy industries. The ease with which aluminum can be handled is demonstrated in a sequence showing a farmer using it for siding and insulation and to irrigate a field. The piping in this scene is shown to be highly portable, being moved in sections by one person. In a \"pageant of packaging\" the film presents row on row of familiar brands parading in step to stirring martial music, against a background of brilliant colors.

Ed Wilson had just begun in his new job as a draftsman when his boss smudged a drawing that he had been working on for several hours. As a result, he vehemently let his boss know how he felt about the matter. Frank McCoy, a fellow worker, explained to Ed that he was using the \"headache switch\" when he lost his temper with the boss and contended that he was just \"letting off steam\" caused by the pressure of a new job and the flat tire he had had on the way to work. Frank suggested that he try several methods for getting the same emotional release without outbursts of anger. The validity of this advice was strengthened when Ed went home and lost his temper with his wife and child. At the time he had forgotten what Frank had advised, but, upon reflection, concluded that his suggestions had merit. The film points out that some people use different techniques to combat emotional tension. In the case of Mike O'Shea, the firm's top salesman, this tension was worked off on the golf course or tennis court. Volpae, the company janitor, accomplished this by working in his garden. Frank McCoy laughed about his problems and made a joke of them. Gus Peterson put all of his energy into his love for the job he was doing and the achievements he made. Another example of emotional stress concerns Mrs. Nugent who had lost an advancement to another person. As a result of her disappointment, she let her appearance get untidy, her work become inadequate, and her attitude with co-workers became surly. Her displacement of anger was evidenced in the form of severe headaches which forced her to go home early so many times that eventually she was replaced. Still another example describes Tony Luciana who became so careless and unable to concentrate on his work when his boy was arrested that he lost a hand when it was smashed in a drill press.

Buds from Delicious trees are next grafted onto the hardy trunks, where they flourish and eventually become fruit. Pruning and irrigation also help the trees to become sturdy and productive. The spring blooms are pollinated by bees, by ladybugs, and by human help, as illustrated in several scenes. The workers who gather, sift, and weigh the pollen are also pictured. Some workers remove the less desirable fruit from the trees to improve the rest, and a helicopter dusts large areas with pest-killing mixtures. In the fall when the apples are ripe, the pickers are shown carefully emptying their full picking bags into wooden crates for hauling to the packing house. The commentator stresses the necessity for preventing bruises which would spoil the perfect fruit. The boxes are unloaded from the low trucks and the apples are washed, sorted, inspected, wrapped in tissue paper, and packed in boxes, which then go to the shipping room.

From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Railroad_Fair The Chicago Railroad Fair was an event organized to celebrate and commemorate 100 years of railroad history west of Chicago, Illinois. It was held in Chicago in 1948 and 1949 along the shore of Lake Michigan, and is often referred to as \"the last great railroad fair\" with 39 railroad companies participating. The board of directors for the show was a veritable \"Who's Who\" of railroad company executives. History of the fair The fair was rapidly planned during the winter and spring of 1948, and originally scheduled to run between July and August of that summer. Erected on 50 acres (200,000 m2) of Burnham Park in Chicago between 21st and 31st Streets,[1] the fair opened after only six months of planning. A grand opening for the fair commenced on July 20 with a parade that featured such spectacles as a military marching band and a replica of a troop train, a contingent of cowboys and Native Americans, a replica of the Tom Thumb, the first American locomotive, and the spry, octogenarian widow of Casey Jones, who served as honorary Grand Master of the parade. One dollar was the price of admission, and, except food, all the attractions, displays, exhibits and shows were free. Besides the thirty-nine railroads who participated in the fair, there were more than twenty equipment manufacturers, including General Motors. The highlight of the Chicago Railroad Fair was the \"Wheels A-Rolling\" pageant. This was a dramatic and musical presentation intended to showcase the development of transportation and the railroads across the country beginning with trails and waterways. The pageant included a recreation of the Golden Spike ceremony at Promontory, Utah, and various historic rolling stock and replicas of equipment in operation. Railroad equipment used in the pageant included: [edit] Original equipment Empire State Express locomotive 999 on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. * No. 222 and coach * No. 637, Zulu and combine car * No. 10250 * Cumberland Valley Pioneer and coach * DeWitt Clinton and three coaches * Empire State Express No. 999 * The General (1948 only)[3] * John Hancock and coach * Illinois Central 201 and coach * Little Butter Cup and two coaches * Minnetonka and two logging trucks * Pioneer and coach * Pioneer Zephyr * Reuben Wells and coach * William Crooks and two coaches * William Mason and baggage car number 10 [edit] Replicas * Atlantic and two replica coaches * Best Friend of Charleston * Chicago horse car * John Bull and coach * Jupiter and combine car * Lafayette and two barrel cars * Pioneer horse car * Pullman coach number 9 * State Street cable car * Tom Thumb locomotive and director's car * Union Pacific 119", "id": "6241_Wheels_A-Rolling_100_Years_of_Railroad_Progress_01_01_12_22"}, {"date": "2012-08-15T05:23:54Z", "id": "6016_Coyote_1_Lamb_0_01_13_30_00", "title": "Coyote 1 Lamb 0"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "From Dawn to Sunset (Part I)", "subject": ["Labor: 1930s", "Consumerism", "Automobiles: Manufacturing"], "description": "This classic example of \"capitalist realism\" depicts a day in the life of Chevrolet workers in the U.S., while attempting to convince them that their own fortunes were inextricably linked to the fortunes of General Motors.", "id": "FromDawn1937"}, {"date": "2004-06-02T11:12:27Z", "title": "Let's Give A Tea", "description": "Describes the proper procedures involved in giving a tea, such as making a guest list, describing the dress and arranging a tea table.

It makes use of many shots of nature and animals along with illustrations of flowers, fish, chicken and cow reproductive processes in order to finally explain human reproduction. The male's role in the human reproductive process is distant -- implied through the similar process that occurs among the animals. Ultimately, the joys of reproduction can be looked forward to in the bond of matrimony. Ocean tides puppies eating Close-up of a cow's calf elephants illustration of a magnifying glass and arrow, labelled \"EGG\", illustration with arrow pointing first to a fish and then an elephant, violet, and a blue-bird illustration of a flower, arrows labelled with \"PISTIL\" and \"OVARY\" illustration of two flowers, labelled \"MOTHER\" and \"FATHER\", with an illustration of a bee the planting of seeds, watering fish in an aquarium Close up of fish eggs illustration of two fish, labels: \"MOTHER\",\"FATHER\", \"MILT\", AND \"EGGS\" illustration of sperm illustration of ocean scene with fish, eggs, and a shell Birds illustration of a chicken, with arrows: \"EGGS\" \"SPERM\", with sperm moving towards egg a baby chick breaking its way out of its egg many chicks crowded together illustration of a cow and a bull, with labels: \"OVARIES, VAGINA, UTERUS\" illustration of a cow with calf in its womb, with label: \"UTERUS\" a calf awkwardly standing up a mother holding a tiny infant Close-up of a wedding band, slow zoom out to a man kissing her hand, both with large Afros illustration of the female reproductive system, with labels: \"OVARY, UTERUS, OVARY\", an egg moves down to the uterus, arrows pointing down uterus (menstruation), arrows pointing up uterus (insemination) illustration of one egg with sperm surrounding it illustration of a young fetus in the womb of a woman, with labels: \"FOETUS, UMBILICAL CORD\", the foetus illustration becomes increasingly larger illustration of the side view of a woman during increasingly later stages of pregnancy, until the foetus is outside Covers the reproductive process in plants and animals. Explains that all life forms on earth share the same beginning -- as a tiny egg. Details and compares the similarities of the reproduction of plants in the garden, fish in oceans and streams, and of birds on land and how these differ from that of humans. Includes illustrations complete with labels of the sexual parts of flowers, a cow and a bull, a mother and a father, sperm and an egg. This film suggests that \u201csince human babies, unlike other animals, are unable to care for themselves after a couple of months or weeks they need the love and protection of Mothers and Fathers for years to come-- this is why two people in love get married before they have children so they can make a home, provide love, care and protections that babies need for years to come. Explains that when a girl is married and mates with her husband millions of sperm from the fathers body enter the mothers vagina\u201d there is no mention how sperm gets in side the woman. The subtle moral message this film imparts is that reproduction is solely an act of marriage. \u201cAnd in years from now when you fall in love and get married, you may experience the greatest miracle of all -- having children of your own.\u201d Footage about how various animal reproduce: flowers, fish, birds, cows, humans. 1970s film on reproduction. 04:01:42:16 Pan over CBS building. 04:05:02:26 Great shot seed planting, CU disembodied hand with gardening shovel digs hole in soil, pours seeds into hole, covers hole, disembodied hand pours waters from metal can over planted seeds. 04:05:53:00 CU small open container of fish eggs or roe, disembodied hand picks up fish egg, rolls it around between thumb and forefinger then replaces it in the container. 04:08:32:18 CU chicken egg; egg cracks open; chick breaks out of egg; CU fluffy chick; dozens of newborn chicks crammed together on top of egg shells. 04:10:35:28 Cute brown and white calf stands up. 04:11:22:10 CU woman\u2019s hand wearing engagement ring holding man\u2019s hand; camera pans out to show 1970s man and woman seated holding hands, both wearing hair in afros.

The Plowshare Program focused on developing nuclear devices exclusively for peaceful purposes. The intent of the Gnome experiment was to evaluate the effects of a nuclear detonation in a salt medium. Historically, Project Gnome consisted of a single detonation of a nuclear device on December 10, 1961 with the Salado Formation. Since the Gnome detonation, the AEC/DOE has conducted surface restoration, site reconnaissance, and decontamination and decommissioning activities at the site. In addition, annual groundwater sampling is performed under a long-term hydrological monitoring program begun in 1972. Coach, an experiment to be located near the Gnome project, was initially scheduled for 1963. Although construction and rehabilitation were completed for Coach, the experiment was canceled and never executed. Known collectively as Project Gnome-Coach, the site is located approximately 25 miles east of Carlsbad, New Mexico, in Eddy County, and is comprised of nearly 680 acres, of which approximately 60 acres are disturbed from the combined AEC/DOE operations.", "id": "0374_GNOME_Project_M03201_05_00_48_00"}, {"date": "2012-04-08T20:59:29Z", "title": "Threads of Technology", "description": "09:12:30:04 CU parabolic lines morphing in and out of each other on an oscilloscope screen, lines begin to accelerate and morph into a sine-wave-like pattern;

Bill Johnson, a garage mechanic, comes home from work on the day before Thanksgiving to find his children completely disheartened by their mother's announcement that the family cannot afford a turkey for the holiday. Shocked at his son Dick's statement that there won't be much to be thankful for, Bill gently reminds him and the other children that while turkey on Thanksgiving is a great American tradition, its presence sometimes obscures the real meaning of Thanksgiving. When Dick concedes that modern Americans are a lot better off than the Pilgrims, the others suggest that they all make a list of the things for which they are thankful. Their father cautions them to give serious thought to their list, which should include only the things they feel deeply. He then watches them mulling over their thoughts as they play during the evening. At the Thanksgiving dinner table, each member of the family offers part of the thanks. Tommy is thankful for plenty of food and free library books to read. Susan mentions clothing, Sunday school, and her family. Dick gives thanks for a chance to get an education and a chance to play. Bill thinks as he looks at Baby Janet that she must be thankful in her own way for fun in the bathtub, playtime, and security. Mrs. Johnson is thankful that her children can grow up healthy and strong, that she can guide them, that her family can have many of the modern conveniences, that she can have freedom of speech, and that Mr. Johnson's job brings peace of mind. Bill Johnson then finishes the list with the things for which he is thankful: a home with privacy, freedom from fear of political reprisal, the right to pick a vocation in which he is happy, freedom of opinion as represented by his newspaper, the right to vote, and the belief that family unity can become world-wide unity.", "id": "0917_Day_of_Thanksgiving_A_00_37_08_00"}, {"date": "2012-04-08T21:06:19Z", "title": "Vista Stock Shots: Some Nightclubs, San Francisco", "subject": ["fixme"], "description": "mostly San Francisco restaurants,", "id": "0564_Vista_Stock_Shots_Some_Nightclubs_San_Francisco"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "[National Recovery Administration (NRA) Promo]", "subject": ["New Deal: NRA", "Durante, Jimmy"], "description": "New Deal-era promo for the NRA (National Recovery Administration).", "id": "National1933"}, {"date": "2011-12-25T19:01:43Z", "title": "San Francisco (1955 Cinemascope film)", "subject": ["san francisco", "amateur film", "widescreen", "Cinemascope, pasta1"], "description": "Cinemascope homage to the city of San Francisco made by amateur filmmaker and inventor Tullio Pellegrini.", "id": "SanFrancisco1955CinemascopeFilm"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Social Security Story, The", "description": "Tour of the new Social Security offices in Woodlawn, Md. and orientation for taxpayers.", "id": "SocialSe1962"}, {"date": "2012-06-28T04:02:49Z", "title": "Bell Labs Picturephone", "description": "no sound.", "id": "0618_Bell_Labs_Picturephone_02_46_33_00"}, {"date": "2007-01-02T21:12:02Z", "id": "AbcsOfWalkin", "title": "ABC of Walking Wisely"}, {"date": "2003-05-26T11:38:54Z", "title": "Labor of Thy Hands", "description": "0631 PA8721 Labor of Thy Hands", "id": "labor_of_thy_hands"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Work Pays America (Part I)", "subject": ["New Deal: WPA"], "description": "How the WPA's program of public works benefits both unemployed workers and American society.", "id": "WorkPays1937"}, {"date": "2012-05-21T21:20:08Z", "title": "[Untitled: Alaska]", "description": "Scenes of Alaskan life", "id": "6184_Untitled_Alaska_01_23_00_00"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "What About Prejudice?", "subject": ["Racism", "Prejudice", "Schools"], "description": "Pioneering film that encourages youth to look into themselves for the causes of prejudice.", "id": "WhatAbou1959"}, {"date": "2012-06-28T06:46:59Z", "title": "ESS", "description": "Title refers to: Electronic Switching System.

This is a warning about the path of casual drug usage leading to \"the point of no return\" and the user being permanently lost to society. Jeanette is introduced to drugs through her new boyfriend and casually pops pills for the first time. However, she rapidly progresses into more extreme forms of drug usage, smoking marijuana and shooting heroin. In order to support their habits Jeanette and her boyfriend begin to steal and her boyfriend is arrested. Left alone with her expensive drug habit, Jeanette turns to prostitution and is arrested, only to suffer in jail and land back on the streets with the same addictions until she dies. A matter-of-fact detective/officer narrates: \"This is America in the second half of the twentieth century and Jeanette is a slave. Not a slave by circumstance of birth or force but by choice. A choice she made herself not so very long ago, a choice that at the time probably seemed no bigger than, 'should I belong or shouldn't I?' The pace of modern teen-age society is often fast. The beat is sometimes frantic. Cultures and backgrounds have been mixed. The need to belong is ever present.\" The camera zooms slowly in through the bars of a jail cell on a face of a young woman, writhing in agony.

But in her confused desire to belong, she allows herself first to share a marijuana cigarette with them, and then spirals into a haze of popping pills, and eventually, with growing fears of apprehension & guilt, shooting heroin, which is, as the narrator warns, the beginning of the end for Jeanette. This stark and scary film decribes what it feels like for Jeanette to be addicted to heroin, confronts \"the temporary or prolonged good\" feelings that slide along with the agony of withdrawal, and catalogues the user's shocking descent into petty crime, prostitution, imprisonment and an untimely death. Filmed in the glaring black & white of many fifties horror films, SEDUCTION OF THE INNOCENT is uncompromising in its intent to sway youngsters from a life of drugs, and unapologetic in its graphic seediness.", "id": "Seduction_of_the_Innocent"}, {"date": "2003-05-27T07:56:17Z", "title": "Logic By Machine (Part II)", "description": "0577 PA8524 Logic By Machine (Computer and the Mind of Man)", "id": "logic_by_machine_2"}, {"date": "2003-05-14T14:16:51Z", "title": "Wreckless", "subject": ["need keyword"], "description": "A Jam Handy \"comedy\" short sponsored by Chevrolet that touts modern car design's impact on safe driving.", "id": "wreckless"}, {"date": "2007-03-01T11:08:19Z", "title": "Pursuit Of Profit", "subject": ["need keyword"], "description": "Presents a survey of independent businesses to show how free enterprise operates and contributes to the strength and stability of the country.", "id": "PursuitOfPro"}, {"date": "2012-07-12T05:17:31Z", "title": "[Home Movies: San Francisco Family 2]", "description": "great shot of street running through Southern California oil field, cars driving down street with oil derricks on both sides", "id": "6401_HM_San_Francisco_Family_Reel_5_Picnics_01_29_29_09"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Dinner Party", "subject": ["Social guidance: Etiquette"], "description": "Dramatized presentation of proper table etiquette for teenagers, heavy on criticism and guilt.", "id": "DinnerPa1945"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "General Motors Around the World (Part III)", "subject": ["Automobiles: Design and manufacturing", "Globalization"], "description": "How one of the first multinational corporations organized itself to sell to the world under the leadership of Alfred R.

This is an American city. A city that is not very large, not very rich, not very old. It is situated in the western part of the United States, in California. Its name is Riverton. The woman in the car is Mrs. Dawson, one of Riverton's fifteen thousand residents. She is principal of Public School No. 2, but today there will be no classes held here. For this is Election Day.\" Tuesday in November is a film in simple language made primarily for overseas audiences, many of whom did not enjoy the right to elect their own governments. It dramatizes both the participation of citizens in the electoral process and the 1944 campaign for the Presidency, linking these two threads into a quasi-religious quest characterized by unchallenged belief, ritualistic behavior and culminating in a mass announcement before a large crowd. The simplicity expressed in the understated narration and many of the images was a conscious choice dictated by the non-English-speaking intended audience, but for us now underscores the film's stature as a morality play. Dramatized, animated and newsreel footage are all mobilized to invoke emotionally charged themes. Solemn honesty is linked with the American electoral process very early in the film as the poll officials convene: \"First they remove the last traces of their campaign activities, their party buttons. Then they take the oath.\" Then the first voter of the day -- a milkman -- enters the booth, but he leaves us behind. \"That's as far as we can go. Remember, this is a secret vote. No one ever sees another person mark his ballot.\" Though he may be simply a milkman, in our system he is invested with great power: \"When Bill Johnson is finished, he has elected an entire government, from top to bottom. That is, if the majority of voters think the way he does about it.\" Newsreel footage follows; without comment, we see African-Americans lining up to vote, probably in New York City. We return to Riverton, where actors playing voters are waiting in line at the polls. One brushes his sleeve against the chalkboard, elegantly segueing into yesterday's history lesson, where two previous wartime elections, 1864 and 1916, were discussed, proving that this is a country secure enough to hold elections in wartime. Newsreel footage shows masses of people turning out for campaign events (what we now call \"retail politics\"); the crowds continue to increase until the end, when New York's Times Square is filled with people waiting for the election returns. As a member of Hollywood's progressive community in the Forties, John Houseman was attracted to documentary film as a means of influencing social change. Wartime found him engaging in propaganda activities for the U.S. government. Tuesday in November was designed to explain the American political system and election process in a simple way that could be easily internationalized. Houseman assembled a skilled production team whose commitment to the ideals shown in the film was clear. Unlike most other films that celebrate American democracy, this one avoids appealing to mythology or to abstract ideals. That Tuesday in November shows the everyday business of elections as a routine, unquestioned exercise in democracy speaks for its honesty and authenticity. The Office of War Information films have been criticized for idealizing and oversimplifying the reality of American life, and there is no question that they do so. Tuesday in November ultimately is a case of wishful thinking, or about how things ought to be. Much of what we see is neither truthful nor completely candid. Elections were being stolen that year of 1944. African Americans were effectively forbidden from voting in many states. Roosevelt was not strongly opposed in the wartime election of 1944. And it would be fair to say that the film's emphasis on mass events and politicians taking their campaigns directly to the people belittles the effect of the mass media in manipulating the public. The mobilization of communications technology in the service of fair and speedily reported election returns is at best a by-product of a media establishment that was set up to manufacture consent. But, by the time the results are being calculated and disseminated, it no longer seems to matter. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people are gathered in Times Square waiting for the returns. Virgil Thomson's score and the searchlights sweeping the crowd vaguely suggest that they are awaiting some sort of visitation. Ultimately, the elegance and authority of the film lends credence to its optimistic view of our system, making it one of those rare propaganda films that has the power to seek out and stir whatever trace of idealism still may survive in your mind. \"All over America tonight, the people are waiting to learn whom they have chosen to govern them for the next four years. Toward midnight, the final results are announced. A nation of a hundred and forty million has elected a government.\" This version of the film, uploaded on 2 April 2012, was digitized from a film transfer which was made from a new 35mm print, which itself was derived from nitrate materials held at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archives in Hollywood, California.

In reaction to perception of substantial growth in the distribution of pornographic material. Homosexuality is considered pornographic per se. Shows frank images often with censoring black bars across them [the bars often obscure very little, simply adding to the air of licentious ness]. \"For the sake of decency in this film we have partially covered the pictures and disguised the identity of the models.\" Excellent footage of magazine covers. Striking art cards like the octopus shown as the symbol of pornography and its mass distribution. Four kinds of magazines shown: girlie, nudist, physique; men's adventure. And cheap paperback exploitation novels. Rare footage of gay men's magazine covers and interiors including \"ONE\" subtitled\"The Homosexual Viewpoint\" May, 1959. Voiceovers: \"A flood tide of filth is engulfing our country in the form of newstand obscenity, it is threatening to pervert an entire generation of our American children.\" Children are the target market: \"We know that once a person is perverted, it is practically impossible for that person to revert to normal attitudes in regard to sex.\" \"No matter who buys this material 75 to 90% of it ends up in the hands of our children.\" Modern technology lends itself to the promulgation of decadence: \"Never in the history of the world have the merchants of obscenity, the teachers of unnatural sex acts had available to them the modern facilities for disseminating this filth. High-speed presses, rapid transportation, mass distribution all have combined to put this violent obscenity within the reach of every man, woman and child in the country.\" \"Through this material, today's youth can be stimulated to sexual activity for which he has no legitimate outlet. He is even enticed to enter the world of homosexuals, lesbians, sadists, masochists and other sex deviants.\" \"They [pornographic magazines] constantly portray abnormal sexual behavior as normal; they glorify unnatural sex acts; they tell youngsters that it's smart, it's thrilling; it provides kicks to be a homosexual, a sadist and every other kind of deviant.\" Community leaders and medical establishment agree about link of pornography to moral decay of country. This weakening also leads to vulnerablity to Communism. \"The military chaplains association of the United States, practically every major fraternal, civic and religious organization, the juvenile court judges, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, innumerable psychiatrists, sociologists, and psychologists attribute the moral decay among our people in very large part to the obscene and pornographic literature so prevalent in our society. This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the Communist masters of deceit.\" Discussion of nudist magazines: \"Very few blind people join the nudist colonies.\" \"A young boy in Philadelphia raped and killed a five-year old girl.\" He testified \"that he had been stimulated to this heinous crime by reading a nudist magazine.\" Prolonged exposure to physique magazines puts even \"normal\" males at risk of becoming perverts (homosexuals). Today's conquest is tommorow's competition: supposed homosexual slogan. Pornography and \"fun\" lead to illegitimate children and hefty financial burden on taxpayers. \"Life is presented as fun. This warped idea of fun has contributed to the fact that one out of every twenty children born in the United States last year was illegitimate. The care of these children cost taxpayers one billion dollars.\" Rise of VD, crime, violence. \"Sex-mad magazines are helping to create criminals faster than we can build jails to house them.\" Also shown is a plan for community organizing campaign. Contacting merchants; writing letters; checking your home etc. \"The law is our weapon.\" \"Report objectionable materials to the police.\" Last line of film \"Oh God, deliver us, America, from evil.\" Art card comes up which says the same.", "id": "0694_Perversion_for_Profit"}, {"date": "2012-04-09T02:13:28Z", "id": "0669_New_York_State_of_Discovery_11_01_14_00", "title": "New York: State of Discovery"}, {"date": "2012-08-03T06:13:02Z", "title": "Scuola Fascista, La [Fascist School, The]", "description": "Incredible footage from within an Italian fascist school in the 1930s to early 1940s.

Filmed in and around Central State Hospital, Norman, Oklahoma. Jack Stevenson's article on Swain and Hockman appears in Brutarian (Vol. 1, No. 1). Documents the case of a mental patient who is treated for schizophrenia (paranoid type) at the Oklahoma State Hospital. Summarizes the treatment of a patient from admission to the hospital to the time of discharge. Explains the methods used in the treatment of mental diseases and stresses the value of occupational therapy in rehabilitating patients and the need for an atmosphere of calm and security. TITLE CARD: Recognizable personages appearing in this film are not patients in a mental institution. PARANOIA / DEPRESSION / INSTITUTIONALIZATION: Man's voice over as he is driven down a gray, snowy road. HE IS VERY PARANOID. He leans his head against the rear window. There's a close up of his eyes, then hands, then mouth. Men in dark, tweed jackets lead him into the hospital. MEDICAL ABUSE: Nurses examine Joe. He has blood taken from his arms, a chest x-ray, and a spinal tap. PARANOIA: Joe talks to an Oklahoman psychiatrist (with a southern accent). He says, \"They're turning my wife, you know, Peg, against me. They're taking up all of her time.\" Joe rings his hands. The psychiatrist replies, \"Why do you think they're doing you this way?\" Joe answers, \"Well, I've been working on this for years. They don't know it but I'm on to them.\" PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING: The narrator describes various treatments for psychological disorders, and we view these methods in action (which look somewhat barbarous to today's viewers). First there's insulin shot therapy in which a patient receives a shot (camera pans down to twitching feet), then electric shock, hydrotherapy, and cold pack therapy.", "id": "mental_hospital"}, {"date": "2012-04-09T01:58:07Z", "title": "America For Me", "description": "Two young women take a Greyhound Bus tour across America.

With the help of a history professor, John Smith (1776) explains how he gave his life to build the USA and nowadays a \"bunch of young hooligans\" are working to destroy it.

There is discussion of H. \"Rap\" Brown (accompanied by archival footage) calling upon student bodies to carry guns. There is also footage and discussion of the riots, burning, and looting done by student activists.

This film was made just five years after The Days of Our Years but belongs to a different world. This is not the close environment of urban railroad workers, but the wide-open spaces of the agricultural West. It was shot in Idaho, and the highway patrolman who carries the film forward wears an Idaho State Patrol uniform. It's summertime and the kids are out of school. Although they are responsible for farm work, they are free to roam the countryside and do. Danger lurks in this mobile world, but not in dark, enclosed industrial spaces -- it lurks in broad daylight along a sunny railroad track. The deaths that form the film's climax happen right after lunch on what looks like a Saturday afternoon, and death takes the young rather than the old. It's hard not to think that the Union Pacific is here again trying to pass the buck on safety. It costs lots of money to protect railroad crossings with gates and even more to construct separations between railroad rights-of-way and highways. Construction projects of this type have always involved contention between railroads and local governments, and the differing interests of railroads and government fill our history books. Suffice it to say that there's a great deal of background that isn't practical to include in the movie. Interestingly enough, the victims drive through a crossing with gates, lights and bells, so no one can pin the responsibility for this accident on corporate greed. The most quotable line: as two railroad crewmen stand by the wrecked automobile, one says: \"\"Why don't they look, Frank?\"\" Frank responds: \"\"I don't know. Why don't they look?\"\" This short dialogue fragment, and in fact the whole movie, has become a big hit on the TV show Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Charged with a didactic agenda, The Last Clear Chance somehow always manages to look interesting even when it gets intensely instructional. It had the benefits of an excellent cinematographer, Bert Spielvogel, who also shot two other visually distinguished films, Design for Dreaming and In the Suburbs and The Relaxed Wife.", "id": "Last_Clear_Chance_The"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "[Frigidaire Imperial Line]", "subject": ["Houses and homes: Kitchens: Refrigerators", "Appliances: Sales", "Advertising: In-house"], "description": "Promotional film for Frigidaire dealers showing features of the new Imperial Line of refrigerators.", "id": "Frigidai1956"}, {"date": "2012-09-05T03:05:11Z", "id": "6393_HM_Can_10878_West_Coast_Mar-April_1936_01_22_04_00", "title": "[Home Movies: Can 10878: West Coast, Mar-April 1936]"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Coffee House Rendezvous (Part I)", "subject": ["1960s", "Youth culture", "Coffee"], "description": "Shows coffeehouses sponsored by churches and community organizations and how they function as gathering places for countercultural youth.", "id": "CoffeeHo1969"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Perversion for Profit (Part II)", "subject": ["Culture wars", "Sexualities", "Pornography"], "description": "Anti-pornography film produced by financier Charles Keating, linking pornography to the Communist conspiracy and the decline of Western civilization.", "id": "Perversi1965_2"}, {"date": "2012-07-07T17:59:58Z", "id": "0381_San_Francisco_Welcomes_Lions_International_40th_Anniversary_Con_12_54_28_00", "title": "[San Francisco Welcomes Lions International 40th Anniversary Convention]"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Around the World in New York", "subject": ["New York City", "Immigration", "Chinese Americans"], "description": "Views of immigrant and ethnic communities in New York City.", "id": "Aroundth1940"}, {"date": "2012-05-02T17:32:30Z", "title": "[Gould can 5423.1]", "description": "\"Street scene on the Barbary Coast\" (Kearny street, San Francisco, California].

Hanging in the sky as if they were ghosts, patriots, warriors and the myths they exemplify -- the frontier, national independence and manifest destiny -- come to life at key points along the transcontinental route. Although Americans are widely considered to be a practical, well-grounded people with their eyes on the future, Freedom Highway shows a nation in need of spiritual and patriotic renewal, and this renewal is to be sought in our past. The bus -- the most democratic means of transportation, a great equalizer between people, is the perfect vehicle for the freedom highway, a big metal box on wheels in which the faithless ride and rediscover their lost belief. The busbound journey through space will become a journey through time as great moments and personalities in U.S. history are recreated. Throughout this century, but especially during the Cold War era, the American landscape has been dominated by visions of past struggles and victories. A look at the familiar images in the supplement, all drawn from vintage road maps, testifies to the familiarity of these visions but also to their more disturbing nature. Most of these images, and most of the images in Freedom Highway, celebrate European exploration, settlement and territorial expansion together with Manifest Destiny, their theoretical inspiration. The Boy Scout, explorer of state parks, vacant lots and fragments of suburban forest, becomes the wide-eyed observer of this mix of present and past. Some souls might be disturbed by this one-sided mythology, like those of Native Americans or those that died to make this expansion possible, but Freedom Highway venerates the past with pride. \"Push 'em through!\" shouts a Civil War-era officer leading a wagon train through Native American land, and an intense battle begins where later Greyhound buses will roll. So begins Freedom Highway. In the United States Magazine and Democratic Review (July 1845), John L. O'Sullivan wrote of \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" O'Sullivan was writing about the annexation of Texas, which was admitted as a state that year, and his expression \"manifest destiny\" would later be invoked in many other contexts, especially by those who, later in the century, sought to annex Cuba. \"Freedom,\" as in Freedom Highway, and manifest destiny are closely linked, and manifest destiny is itself linked to road building, to breaking through, to \"fighting for our right of way,\" in the words of the General Motors film Give Yourself the Green Light (1954). Our national obsession with building highways and personalized individual transportation is embodied in our view of freedom as an open road stretching out into the distance. This entertaining \"story of America,\" as endless as a cross-country bus ride, places an unusual group of travelers on a long-haul Greyhound bus. Fred Schroder, embittered by the death of his son in Korea, is riding to Washington to accept a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor on the son's behalf. Jimmy Rollins, the Scout, is heading to Washington for his first Jamboree. Love interest is supplied by Mary (a young Angie Dickinson) and Bill Roberts, a basketball star on the make. Tex Ritter, playing himself, takes a short ride on the bus as it passes through Texas, singing about the Alamo and the \"freedom road.\" Most important of all, a black-suited mysterious stranger appears, as if from nowhere, to transform the outlook of the passengers, who include us, the audience. With all the subtlety and depth of a Reader's Digest article, each passenger will do their bit to squeeze patriotic meaning out of the landscape. And yet there's nothing particularly American in the way this film works; one wants to find the Soviet equivalent, which probably is set on the Trans-Siberian Express.", "id": "0686_Freedom_Highway"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Choosing a Classroom Film", "subject": ["Motion pictures: In education"], "description": "Illustrates the purposes of educational films and the standards by which to appraise them.", "id": "Choosing1963"}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Seeing Green", "subject": ["Safety: Driving"], "description": "Inside the electrochemical \"brain\" of the traffic light.", "id": "SeeingGr1937"}, {"date": "2012-06-28T05:15:59Z", "title": "[Gould can 5161.10]", "description": "Los Angeles, California: Aftermath of Grand Prize automobile race.

The cultivation and use of the soybean as an illustration of the relation of science to agriculture and the interrelation of science, agriculture, and industry. Opens with a view of an Oriental farmer beginning to harvest his crop of soybeans. The commentator explains that the soybean has been cultivated for centuries in the Orient. A map showing first China and then the United States is accompanied by the explanation that the soybean has been grown extensively in the United States since 1918. An agronomist is shown examining experimental fields of the soybean as the commentator explains that agriculture experiment stations have played an important part in the development of the use of the soybean in the United States. The agronomist pulls up a plant for examination as the commentator explains that he is interested in the soybean as a means of conserving soil fertility. In the laboratory the agronomist examines the nodules which have formed on the roots of the soybean plant. The commentator explains the function of the bacteria-filled nodules in building the nitrogen content of the soil. The agronomist removes some soybean bacteria from a culture cabinet. The bacteria are mixed with charcoal. Later, the bacteria-charcoal mixture is diluted with water and sprinkled on some soybean seed, thus inoculating the seed and making nodule growth possible on new plants. The agronomist decides to visit a nearby farm where soybeans are being grown. On his way he passes two fields of corn. One field is poor because of improper rotation practice. The other field is good because of the use of the soybean in a good plan of crop rotation. The agronomist stops at the roadside to talk to the farmer's wife, who is gathering edible soybeans. When the agronomist arrives at the soybean field, the farmer is mowing soybean hay. They discuss the proper time for cutting soybeans for this purpose. The farmer says that he has another field of beans which he expects to harvest in about a month. A combine is shown in operation in a field of soybeans. Particular attention is called to the fact that the combine returns to the ground the straw containing much nitrogen. A truck receives the beans from the combine hopper and they are started on their way to the processing plant. At the processing plant the beans are dumped out of the truck, cracked, and fed into expellers. Soybean oil is shown trickling out of the compression chambers where, the commentator explains, the beans have been subjected to intense heat and great pressure. Soybean oil is also filtered. Brief views indicate that the oil is used in paint, linoleum, shortening, and salad dressing. Meal, which is fed to dairy and beef cattle, is shown coming out of the press and being loaded into bags. An industrial chemist is shown at work in his laboratory as the commentator explains that such men are working to find new uses for soybean oil and meal. This particular chemist is striving to improve the process by which soybean meal is converted into a plastic. Some soybean meal is mixed with formaldehyde, placed on calender rolls which mix it with other ingredients, then tested on a flow tester which records plasticity. The mixture is placed in a mold which, in turn, is placed in a hydraulic press, where it is subjected to great pressure. The chemist removes a small plastic article from the mold. Many articles made from soybean plastics are displayed on a revolving wheel. One finished piece of plastic material is tested on a flexural testing machine. The agronomists and the industrial chemist are shown at work in their laboratories. Appraisal. Reported very good for showing (1) the procedure in producing and processing soybeans, (2) the contribution of science to industry and agriculture, (3) the interdependence of agriculture and industry, (4) the use of legumes in soil building, and (5) the role of government experimentation in agriculture. Should be useful in showing the work of the agronomist and the research chemist and indicating the adjustment of agriculture to new conditions. The film was reported to be well organized to show the interrelation of science, industry, and agriculture.

The opening sequence shows Paul cautiously and timidly entering his parents' bedroom in the early morning hours. Helen, his mother, invites him into her bed and lovingly cuddles him up to her. Their conversation awakens Jim, who sullenly remonstrates about Paul's awakening them at this early hour. A series of episodes accompanying the family breakfast shows that Helen and Jim understand each other but don't understand Paul. When Paul observes his father and mother kissing each other, he feels very much neglected. Later when Jim blames him for having a turtle in the way and also for not assuming a sufficient amount of responsibility, he feels very misunderstood. He finally agrees to having breakfast; but because he is practically commanded by his parents to drink his orange juice, he unfavorably compares it with the loving way in which his mother offers his father coffee. When he accidentally upsets the coffee, his father orders him to go to his room. Alone in his room, he angrily throws the teddy bear which his father had recently given him and then violently kicks it. Later in the afternoon, Helen and her friend Alice take a walk and allow their children, Paul and Mike, to ride their bicycles. Several incidents show that Alice gives Mike much more freedom and encouragement than Helen gives Paul. When Paul becomes very frightened after entering a park cave formed by huge rocks, his mother is tempted to force him to back into the cave to overcome his fear. Her friend Alice interferes, suggesting that it would be harmful to Paul. Later, over a cup of coffee at Alice's home, Alice says that she and Mike have come to understand that little boys get angry and that parents should accept it and not reciprocate. She explains that she and her husband had had trouble with Mike, too, but that their doctor had told them that the way to overcome Mike's fears was to be kind to him and to encourage him. Later that evening, when Jim returns, Helen tells him about Alice's and Mike's experiences. Jim obstinately insists that the time has arrived to teach Paul to overcome his fears and to assume responsibility. His refusal to allow Paul to have a light on in his room is climaxed by a nightmare in which Paul associates his father with a bear. Even when he is awake, he pleads with his mother to take the bear, indicating his father, out of the room. Jim leaves and Helen manages to get Paul back to sleep. Alone in the living room Helen and Jim realistically discuss the problems which seem to be facing Paul, and Jim comes to the terrible realization that his son is afraid of him. He resolves to be more friendly and understanding toward Paul. The concluding sequence shows Paul and his father at the entrance to the same cave which earlier had frightened Paul. When Paul refuses to enter, his father affectionately lifts him high on his shoulders and takes him where he wants to go.

A plea for community planning, which contrasts the awesome conditions of human living in a modern industrial city with (1) the serenity of life in an eighteenth-century New England village and (2) the architect's and engineer's concept of the model community, as typified by the federal government's resettlement experiment at Greenbelt, Maryland, and the privately developed one at Radburn, New Jersey. Life in the New England village of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century is described. There are slowly unfolding views of an old water wheel, a covered bridge, the swimming hole, and other scenes characteristic of the period. A town meeting is shown in session; the speaker at the meeting talks of the village way of life and his remarks are illustrated by views of people at simple handicraft tasks. The transition to the modern industrial city is made by the merging of a shower of sparks from the smithy's forge with those from a Bessemer converter in a modern steel mill. The scenes change to smokestacks against the sky, to molten slag flowing down the dump, and to the miserable company houses. Children walk along the crude wooden sidewalks. One child narrowly escapes death when he and his companions run across a railroad track in front of a train. A woman pumps water a few feet from an outdoor toilet, hangs the washing in a smoke-filled atmosphere, and shovels coal into an outmoded kitchen stove. Such symbols of industrialism as smokestacks, locomotives, and steam shovels are shown as the musical tempo is accelerated and the commentator echoes the phrases \"better and better\" and \"faster and faster.\" Now attention is turned to the great metropolis, New York. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers, human beings mill through city streets, push out of subways, and squeeze through seemingly endless lines of mid-town traffic. The music works up to a screech symbolic of the nervous tension and speed of life in the metropolitan business center. An office scene of long rows of girls at typewriters is accompanied by a chorus of dictation\u2014mechanical and impersonal. The environment in which children live and play is depicted by scenes of a street accident in which an ambulance takes away the victim, of boys who play stick ball in the street, steal rides on trucks and streetcars, rummage through garbage, and dive from a dock for a swim in a dirty river. At the lunch hour people gulp coffee and eat sandwiches in an atmosphere of confusion\u2014sandwiches are slapped together, toast bounces out of a toaster, and pancakes pour automatically on an automatic griddle. Workers return to work through streams of traffic. Long lines of people wait at clinics and dispensaries. At the end of the day the crowds begin to pour out of buildings and start home. Crowds of pedestrians, a traffic jam, traffic officers, traffic signals, together with a shrill, wrenching musical score, create a sense of confusion and tension. Then comes Sunday. The business district is deserted, but on the highway cars move in a constant stream. Caught in a traffic jam a driver sits and waits. A family picnics on the roadside as the traffic whizzes by. Cars crash bumpers; a car plunges over a cliff. The next section of the film is the architect's and engineer's solution to the problem. Scenes of Boulder Dam, power lines, research laboratories, airplanes, and streamlined trains convey the impression that science in modern society can provide a way to better living. Modern highway designs are shown as new developments in beauty and safety. There is an aerial view of a well-patterned community which the commentator calls \"a green city\" built away from crowded metropolitan conditions. In a modern factory employees are shown in a leisurely conducted dining room. Employees walk happily to homes of modern design with adequate lawn space. Recreation facilities are symbolized with views of horseback riding, bicycling, softball games, swimming, gardening, and fishing. An electric stove and an electric washing machine show that much of the drudgery has been taken from housework. The community newspaper comes off the press and is delivered to the front porch. Shopping is done at a modern market; the vegetables, the commentator explains, come from nearby farms. Families leave \"the green city\" by automobiles for recreation at the golf course, the swimming pool, the skating rink, and the ocean beach. A concert platform, a medical clinic, and a school are shown as parts of the community facilities. Views contrasting \"model\" housing with crowded tenements, and children playing in large playgrounds with children playing in the dirty street are accompanied by the statement, \"Take your choice.\" Scenes of \"cities in which people are always getting ready to live . . .\" are followed by scenes of the life that the picture suggests is possible in \"a green city.\"", "id": "0545_City_The"}, {"date": "2012-04-08T20:56:13Z", "title": "Holiday for Bill", "description": "Includes close-up of 78 rpm record spinning. 21:39:31:05 Great shot woman in driver\u2019s seat of tractor starts up tractor as man in 1940s suit climbs into cart attached to tractor, woman\u2019s begins driving causing man to fall into the cart; VS woman driving tractor down dirt road man wearing suit in cart pulled by tractor yelling at woman to let him out. 21:39:48:20 CU mailbox with \u201cWm.

DATELINE: LONG ISLAND is first about the history of Long Island, \"America's fastest growing community\" and \"an exceptional place likely to attract exceptional men\" - people like Theodore Roosevelt and Walt Whitman, who both lived there - as well as a rapidly developing cosmopolitan suburbia with the best homes, the best stores, the best schools. Shots of Lindbergh's flight & developing downtown areas lead into the founding of Newsday, the liberal, independent and world class communications system founded in 1947, and which helped change, among other things, the archaic building codes that prohibited World War II veterans and their families from finding affordable housing. The result was Levittown. Also featured are more new stories of important events that Newsday played a hand in, and little interviews with Alicia Patterson, the editor & publisher, and other staff people and members of the board. A real, proud advertisement for Newsday, this film is full of abundantly wholesome American images, from farms to bowling to riflery.", "id": "0515_Dateline_Long_Island_04_00_59_26"}, {"date": "2007-03-01T15:37:50Z", "title": "Stillman Fires Collection: Ship Fires", "subject": ["need keyword"], "description": "from Stillman Fires Collection.", "id": "Pa2099ShipFi"}, {"date": "2012-08-06T06:49:58Z", "id": "6174_Food_A_Film_Lesson_in_Health_and_Hygiene_21_18_20_00", "title": "Food: A Film Lesson in \"Health and Hygiene\""}, {"date": "2002-07-16T00:00:00Z", "title": "Molly Grows Up", "subject": ["Sex education", "Gender roles", "Children"], "description": "Menstruation education film for young teenage girls, redolent with dated detail.", "id": "MollyGro1953"}, {"date": "2012-04-08T22:37:45Z", "title": "Living Past (Part 3)", "description": "Includes President Theodore Roosevelt, the changing scene, New York's finest (police,) Rough Riders, Roosevelt's conservation policies.", "id": "0634_Living_Past_Part_3"}, {"date": "2012-04-05T17:06:40Z", "title": "United News", "description": "Lidice, Illinois residents gather to perpetuate memory of martyred village, dedicate memorial.

Some of the protective systems of the human organism as they operate in the body's defense against disease. The commentator discusses social and economic tragedies resulting from infectious diseases. As a bacteriologist is shown at work, the commentator says that ultimate victory in the fight against disease requires continued study of the organisms causing disease and of the complicated interplay of defensive mechanisms operating within the body. Accompanying a view of the skin, the commentator states that, as long as this protective coating remains uninjured, bacteria cannot break through easily. The commentator says that the mucous membrane that lines walls of breathing channels and digestive passages is a part of the body's primary defense. Animation shows a blanket of sticky mucus riding on cilia beneath. An object is carried by ciliary action along the mucous membrane of a frog's throat. There are views of nasal passages through which mucus passes to the stomach. As a section of the stomach is shown, the commentator explains that the mucous membrane acts as a barrier to bacteria. Accompanying a drawing of the viscera, the commentator states that the mucous lining continues through the intestines and that injury to this delicate membrane may result in local inflammation. That such inflammation in the region of the appendix may result in appendicitis in human beings is illustrated by contrasting views of normal, inflamed, and ruptured appendixes. Protective and defensive mechanisms that operate after the skin is punctured are illustrated by drawings of leucocytes leaving capillary walls to move toward bacteria. Microscopic views show the manner in which phagocytes surround and devour the bacteria. A pus-filled abscess forms as blood fluids leak through the vessel wall and support the walling-off action of the phagocytes. By drawings of the lymphatic passages, the beginnings of the second line of defense are shown. Bacteria from a nail wound enter lymphatic passages and are carried in the lymph to filtering bodies called lymph nodes. Within these are mazelike passages lined with phagocytic cells. The following scenes show the distribution of these nodes in various parts of the body. The third line of defense is introduced by a drawing of the circulatory system. There follow views of bacteria passing through the circulatory system, finally reaching the liver and the spleen. Here they are engulfed as they run the gantlet of devouring kupffer cells. A title states that during all these processes the body tissues have been stimulated to produce invisible chemical substances called \"antibodies\" which enhance the capacity of the body to resist further attacks by bacteria of the same kind. There follow scenes that demonstrate the action of serum upon typhoid bacteria as it causes them to agglutinate, thus facilitating phagocytosis. This same process is demonstrated with the use of cholera germs. Vaccination, by which antibody production is artificially induced, and antitoxin injection, by which antibodies are injected into the blood stream, are demonstrated.", "id": "0761_Body_Defenses_Against_Disease_05_45_35_00"}, {"date": "2012-08-27T04:29:06Z", "title": "Head On", "description": "THE BOX-GIRDER FRAME IS THE STRONGEST AUTOMOBILE FRAME THAT CAN BE BUILT.

(Safety at Play)", "description": "Why Take Chances? was a sequel to Sid Davis' very successful picture Live and Learn (1951), another safety film for children that used bluntly forceful simulated accidents to show the results of carelessness. Sid Davis \u2014 child actor, stand-in for John Wayne, mountain climber and movie producer \u2014 made more than 100 films about dangers that befall children and teenagers, including accidents, narcotics, sexual transgression and psychological stress. Danger always lurks in the placid Southern California landscapes of his films, but as in many safety films, the fascination of danger and misbehavior often tends to distract from the intended cautionary messages. One doesn't always have to reject Davis' messages or doubt his sincerity in producing these films, but the films do tend to stimulate many different readings. One not-so-obvious issue I think was on his mind was the effect of rapid urbanization and population growth in the Los Angeles area after World War II (Davis himself had first settled in Los Angeles in 1926), when neighborhoods with a small-town feeling became quickly amalgamated into an almost-endless big city. In such an ugly city, \"dangerous strangers\" lurked everywhere, waiting to turn good girls into bad girls, to corrupt and injure youth. The postwar landscape and composition of LA \u2014 new neighborhoods, construction sites, backyards littered with obsolete prewar refrigerators \u2014 also formed a matrix of risks for children, a map of exposures to jeopardy and danger. Considering this, many of his films (including, certainly Why Take Chances) can be seen as protests against what the newer Los Angeles had become and as attempts to draw new boundaries for children. Davis received many awards from criminal justice and youth organizations and distributed his own films from 1948 through the early 1980s with great success. He is an excellent example of the self-taught entrepreneur who entered the educational film business after World War II, set up a vertically integrated organization, and helped to define the nature of the audiovisual material that postwar kids saw in school. His first film (The Dangerous Stranger, 1948), a film warning kids against potential molesters, was made with funds supplied by John Wayne, cost a thousand dollars to make, and sold thousands of prints since at that time it filled a unique niche. Kind of a follow-up to Live and Learn -- with more kids getting burned, crushed, and battered -- though nowhere near as entertaining.

Science film positioning atomic energy as both a peaceful and a warlike force. Sponsored by a corporation involved in the nascent nuclear industry, the film is an animated introduction to atomic energy and designed to be, as a Business Screen reviewer reported, \u201centertaining but scientifically accurate.\u201d The periodic table, represented as \u201cElement Town,\u201d depicts each element in a distinctive shape suggesting its use by humans. Radium, whose giant head resembles an atomic nucleus, decays into an unstable state and begins to jitterbug to the sound of an old Victrola. The short ends with a majestic atomic giant straddling the earth. Our future, the narrator says, \u201cdepends on man\u2019s wisdom, on his firmness in the use of that power.\u201d NOTE: This example from GE\u2019s Excursions in Science series presents a portentous message in a humorous, self-deprecating manner.

In the early 1920s, the Michigan Observation Company sought places of high elevation to erect fifty foot high enclosed platforms to boost tourism. In southern Michigan, a tower was placed atop Bundy Hill in Hillsdale County, Michigan and officials sought a knoll in the heart of the Irish Hills in Lenawee County. A farmer who owned half of the knoll, Edward Kelly, turned down the company's offer to purchase his portion of the land. The adjoining land owner, Thomas Brighton, consented the sale of his plat, and construction of the Irish Hills Observatory commenced. [1] The opening of the Irish Hills Observatory was announced by The Brooklyn Exponent in September 1924. In a gala celebration on October 4 and 5, hundreds of people ascended the hill and tower to gaze upon the rolling landscape and crystal blue lakes in all directions. Kelly seemed spited by the exploitation of the MOC's venture, and protested by erecting his own tower. By the end of November, 1924, his own observation platform was in place, just feet away from the MOC's structure, and several feet higher. The Michigan Observation Company responded by adding a second observation enclosure to the top of its own facilities, now designated as the \"Original Irish Hills Tower\". Kelly proceeded to add a raised platform to his \"Gray\" tower (named as such because of its gray-painted exterior), an act which brought the two edifices to an even height. The MOC informed Kelly that if he attempted to compete with more height given to his tower, they would tear down their own and construct a metal observatory so large that Kelly's efforts would be nullified. He conceded, and turned his efforts instead to drawing more revenue to his creation. The Irish Hills Towers operated as separate and competitive entities through the 1950s, when Frank Lamping acquired both and connected them with a gift shop at the ground floor. They briefly closed in the late 1960s, and refurbished in 1972 by Allen Good. They were given new observation platforms and as a result attained a near identical look. [2] The Irish Hills Towers closed to the public at the end the summer of 2000, but remain as silent, weather-worn sentries atop one of the highest points in the Irish Hills.", "id": "HM_Lenawee_County_Michigan_Highway_Swimming_Baseball_Kite_Flyin"}, {"date": "2012-08-04T15:16:10Z", "id": "6309_Pathe_News_Epochal_Air_Flight_01_12_06_10", "title": "Pathe News: Epochal Air Flight"}, {"date": "2012-07-26T23:14:22Z", "title": "[Boston, Massachusetts and Vicinity]", "description": "Poor-quality color footage of Boston historical landmarks and tourist sites.

Directed by Alexander Hammid. Filmed in and around the Huron Valley Child Guidance Clinic in Michigan. This simple and affecting story tells how Tommy Randall comes to understand the anger that has led him to steal money from his teacher's purse. It shows how he is helped by Dr. Marshall, a psychiatrist at the Child Guidance Clinic, and how his mother's conversations with Miss Clark, a psychiatric social worker, help her to come to terms with her feelings toward Tommy and her own mother. Angry Boy portrays the mental health establishment as a benevolent force dedicated to unselfish service. Alexander Hammid's sensitive direction makes this all plausible as well as moving. All kinds of stereotypical and overdetermined behavior is shown in the film, but it never feels plodding or predictable. Much of the movie is structured around flashbacks showing family interactions and events, accompanied by the voices of the clinicians discussing what happened. The feeling of intervention and oversight, maybe even surveillance, is very real here. ANGRY BOY, \" is the dramatization of the story of Tommy Randall, a pre-adolescent boy who because of emotional disturbances engendered by family tensions becomes involved in stealing at school. As introductory scenes show children's drawings and children's informal relationships with one another, the narrator points out that children are hard to understand. Tommy Randall is shown reacting with hostility toward Miss Turner, his teacher, when she stops a fight between him and a classmate. His face continues to register anger as she leaves the room. On his way out he sees her purse and follows his impulse to steal. As he is removing the money, Miss Turner returns. The next scene is a telephone conversation between Mr. Kern, the principal, and Tommy's mother. Mr. Kern suggests that Tommy has possibly been involved in other acts of stealing and that he feels strongly that the case is so complex that Mrs. Randall should request the assistance of the Child Guidance Bureau. Mrs. Randall is next shown at the Bureau in consultation with Miss Clark, a psychiatric social worker. The interview reveals her emotions of anger, disappointment, and sense of failure which she experienced when she learned Tommy had been caught stealing. She reveals again and again her efforts to be a good mother and to give Tommy the love and affection her mother had been too busy to give her. When Mrs. Randall is ready to leave, Miss Clark suggests that she go ahead without Tommy, who is in conference with the psychiatrist, Dr. Marshall. As the narrator explains that this is the Huron Valley Child Guidance Clinic, in Michigan, and that its services are available to maladjusted and emotionally disturbed children, the film shows Tommy visiting with Dr. Marshall and on a later visit taking the picture story test under a psychologist. As the staff of the Guidance Clinic discuss their findings, the film shows the incidents they discuss. A kitchen scene reveals Mrs. Randall completely dominating her husband and Tommy, and then in turn being dominated and frustrated by her mother. She becomes so emotionally upset by the incident that she excuses herself from dinner and retreats to her bedroom with a headache. The dinner is finished without her, but under certain etiquette restrictions set down by her. Mr. Randall and Tommy are just ready to start a game of checkers when she returns and stops the game. She insists that Tommy study fractions with her. When her mother warns that she should let them alone, she says that she is doing this for Tommy's good. Flashbacks, accompanied by the psychiatric and psychological clinicians' analyses, show the tensions, hostility, and frustration being created by these family relationships. The Bureau staff conference concludes with Miss Clark's suggesting that progress is being made, as Mrs. Randall begins to understand the problems, and with Dr. Marshall hoping that \"she will give the boy some air of his own to breathe.\" Tommy's subsequent visits with Dr. Marshall show that the boy is becoming more tolerant and is developing the capacity for love and understanding. His admitting that he tripped a little girl and shot Dr. Marshall with a dart because he did not like them helps him to understand and even begin to remove such hate. As Mrs. Randall is helping Tommy to prepare for summer camp, Tommy reveals how much he will miss Dr. Marshall. He even says that he wants to stay home so he can see him during the summer. Then he has the idea that if he goes to camp he can tell Dr. Marshall about the many things that happen there. Dr. Marshall concludes with the statement that Tommy is learning to express his feelings without hurting himself or others and that more and more parents and teachers are understanding and accepting children as human beings.

When an assembly speaker at the high school talks of girls who studied home economics in college, Kay is smitten. But it is a big thing for someone in her family to attend college. She convinces her parents to make the sacrifice and is so eager to leave that she is packing her bags just minutes after receiving her acceptance letter. There is more than a hint here that she wants something more than her family or high school can ordinarily offer. \"What is home economics?\" the narrator asks, hinting at the field's complexity: it is an interdisciplinary field that unites the arts and sciences with traditionally female activities, thus feminizing many otherwise neutral activities. In home economics, physics classes teach toaster-testing, and women chemists study the interaction of tomato soup and milk. Says the narrator: \"All the classes seemed to fit together. Even the physics class was what a girl would like. It was about physics in the home. This course helped you to understand just what makes things run. Then, in household equipment, you could study the practical side: the use of an appliance. In turn, there were courses in foods and nutrition where you learned the why as well as the how.\" As a discipline, home economics looks both forward and backward. Although it enables women to leave the home and play essential roles in institutions, corporations, and schools (\"She could see herself at the center of a world made up of large ovens and mixers manned by professional cooks\"), home economists' work, seen as \"women's work,\" has not been valued as highly as less essential work that happens to be performed by men. Even the professionalization of the home economics sphere has not kept its activities from being taken for granted. Historically connected to social movements like progressivism, to the empowering of women and immigrants, and to activism in the service of public health, home economics has a socially active side as well. Although The Home Economics Story expresses all of these (except social activism), the film emphasizes over and over that, most important of all, the training enables women to take care of their families and children. \"Each girl has been preparing for two careers. One her chosen specialty, the other is a career in homemaking.\" The students are not allowed to forget that they will be women first and home economists second. Kay fantasizes herself as a wife putting her training into practice at home. And there is a pitch for a traditionally female focus on emotions and psychology rather than on the material world: \"The girls learn a lot from the children of the nursery school . . . how habits and attitudes learned at this stage are so important in later life. They learn how much depends on getting along with others . . . for, after all, we live in a world where people are more important than things.\" The Home Economics Story is also a great evocation of fifties college life, rich in culture and prescribed rituals; interestingly enough, at least in the home ec division, it is a world made up almost exclusively of women. Although a few football players and a prom date or two come and go, these four girls and their classmates spend four years together; their last year they even live together in the Home Management house. Louise has \"the most envied task\"-taking care of a baby. This is a free space for women to learn among themselves, single-sex education at its most rarefied-at least until Beth first sports her wedding ring. Iowa State College's Film Production Unit made many films relating to home economics, including Yarn About a Kitchen (1955), a time-and-motion study of meal preparation, in which the woman's movements are marked by a three-dimensional trail of yarn throughout the kitchen. As a university production, The Home Economics Story is fascinating to watch and compare with other educational and sponsored films of its time. There are a number of technical glitches involving sound and picture, and I have a persistent feeling that the movie was handed off to different directors during its production. Nonetheless its fair-to-middling production values seem appropriate for a self-promotional and self-published film, and it reminds us how 16mm production enabled so many institutions to turn to film as a way of reaching the public with their stories.

It documents one of several experiments carried on by various state universities -- experiments sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Inc. -- to discover what schools can do to raise the level of living in the communities they serve.\" Slow moving and sad film which makes the case for education which will improve people's lives directly. Makes the case that people shown in the film need to be instructed in how to farm correctly and what to plant so that they may eat better. Story of mountain people who have farms which are not bountiful. Much mournful music. Shows life in a poor family living in a small wooden house. Wall covered with newspapers to keep out drafts. The pregnant mother prepares corn pone cooked in pork grease and pieces of pork for breakfast. Narrator explains that these children don't get enough and the right things to eat. The house has signs over the doorways like \"We are Thankful\". Voiceover about the irrelevance of school books to the lives of these poor farm children. \"The sons of the sons of the men who clear it [the land] still plant the corn from the same old seeds.. . their lives set in old patterns, in worn-out grooves, new ideas are not easy to come by when learning passes from mouth to mouth, from father to son.\" \"Corn and pork, corn pone and pork sausage and pork gravy. The hog slaughtered in the fall must last the winter. The hog provides the meat for the sausage and the grease for the gravy. Often there isn't enough to eat, never the right things to eat. No green vegetables and milk; no calcium for teeth and bones; no vitamins to prevent rickets, scurvy. Weak bones from poor food; poor food from poor land. Kids growing up to the same years of hunger; babies being born without a chance of strong bodies. These are good people, proud people. Sons and daughters of pioneers, cousins of the people who built America.\" \"They use the same books that all the other children in the state use, the same books as the children use in mining towns, in mill towns, and in great industrial centers. Some of them are good books. But they talk about another kind of world. The books do not tell of how to rotate crops and what makes balanced farming. They do not name the way lessons can be applied to the mountain people.\" \"Next year, the children will study materials prepared in their own communities to teach them facts about soil and food along with reading and writing. . . .The children must learn a new way. The land is tired of corn, but small plots of it could be enriched for raising vegetables. Children must learn to raise goats for milk. They must learn to reforest the hills. It's too late now for the old ones.

The story of the growing of wheat and of some aspects of life on a large-scale wheat farm. Preparation of the soil is the theme of the first sequence. As the commentator informs us that Mr. White is \"a typical wheat farmer,\" Mr. White plows his field with a tractor and gang plow. After a brief conversation concerning the progress of the work, the farmer's son, Tom, exchanges places with his father and the plowing continues. The grain drill is filled, and the tractor pulls the drill across the field. Closeups show the manner in which the drill plants the seed. The commentator's explanations of climatic requirements and hazards of wheat farming are illustrated by brief scenes of storm clouds, of rain falling on a field of growing wheat, of poor wheat in rain-soaked soil, and of scattered stalks of wheat bending before blasts of wind. The activities of the White family are sketched in the next sequence. As Mr. White milks his cows and repairs his fence, the commentator explains that the farmer's work is varied. Tom White is repairing the tractor when his sister brings him the announcement of a 4-H Club meeting. At the meeting a boy explains how he planted and cared for the family strawberry patch, a girl tells of baking a cake, and Tom White explains his care of a prize steer. The talks of the 4-H Club members are illustrated by views of the activities described. The story of harvesting the ripened wheat, hiring and feeding harvest hands, and marketing the grain is told in the last portion of the film. Mr. White walks into the field and tests the ripeness of the wheat by crushing a few heads in his hands, blowing off the chaff, and examining the grains. He calls a neighbor on the telephone and asks him to operate the combine. In town he hires two men who are loafing on the street to help with the harvest. The harvest begins as the combine lumbers across the field. Cutter bars flash in the sun, the reel throws the grain onto the conveyer, and the grain pours into the hopper, as the commentator explains the operation of the combine. Then comes the harvest dinner. Mrs. White finishes cooking dinner, and Mr. White calls, \"Time for dinner.\" After drawing water at a windmill pump, the harvest workers wash, then sit down and eat from a food-laden table. After dinner the men return to the field, and again the combine cuts its way through the ripened wheat. A truck pulls alongside the combine, receives a load of grain from the hopper, and drives away. The grain is unloaded at the local grain elevator. Alternate views of a bread sign in a bakery window, a machine kneading dough, a baker weighing and rolling dough, and people eating bread emphasize the importance of wheat as a food. Appraisal. Reported very good for showing how wheat is produced -- the type of land used, methods of planting and harvesting, the effect of climatic conditions, and the work of the farmer. Found useful in (1) developing an appreciation of the progress that has been made in agricultural methods and equipment, (2) showing the life of a wheat farmer and his family, and (3) stimulating an interest in the farmer's problems. The film is organized about the life of a single family, uses characters and dialogue effectively, and tells its story clearly. In the elementary school, teachers were well pleased with the manner in which the film shows the cooperation of the entire family in the farm enterprise. At the junior and senior high school levels there was some criticism of lack of emphasis on problems of the small farmer.
